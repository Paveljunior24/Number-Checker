## Interactive Number Checker

An interactive menu for performing various numerical and string checks, including verifying Armstrong numbers, generating Fibonacci sequences, and checking for palindromes. The script is designed to be user-friendly and includes error handling for invalid inputs.

### Features

1. **Check Armstrong Number**
   - An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
   - Example: 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

2. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**
   - Generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
   - Example: For \(n = 10\), the output will be the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

3. **Check Palindrome**
   - Checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.
   - Example: "radar" is a palindrome, whereas "hello" is not.

### Usage
